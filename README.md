  ### Description
The purpose of this project is build a pipelane that lands data in Hadoop Filesystem in a queryable format. Using Google Cloud Platform and Docker Containers to run all my applications, I fetch a nested json file of online assessment data and built a pipeline using Kafka and Spark. I also used PySpark queries to find some basic information about the data. The report linked below has a detailed breakdown of how my pipeline was built as well as my findings from this dataset.
