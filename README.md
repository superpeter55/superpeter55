# About Me

Data Science Masters student at UC Berkeley School of Information. I am passionate about providing companies with the insight they need to make correct decisions from data.

I have experience using various data science tools to deliver value to businesses. This includes Python programming modules like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib in conjunction with Jupyter Notebooks to produce yearly projections. I have also used R Markdown to produce KPI reports.

I also have project experience with statistical analysis. This includes hypothesis testing, linear regression, and statistical modeling. I used these statistical tools in conjunction with R to build a causal model between national park visits and other covariates like COVID cases, vaccination % and others.

I have familiarity working with data engineering tools as well including CLI, GitHub, Google Cloud, BigQuery, Kafka, Spark and others. I believe my passion for using data to improve business decisions along with my skills would make me an asset to any company.

  <summary><b> Does credibility in the scientific community translate to credibilitly in the general public? </b></summary>
    
  ### Description
  
  There's a growing phenomena of skepticism and outright rejection of scientific findings across the world, critically dubbed the Anti-Science movement. The common hypothesis is that people are less likely to accept peer-reviewed, published scientific findings and more likely to accept anecdotal findings of like-minded individuals. Some of this phenomena is attributed to a Fake News crisis, where it has become increasingly easy to spread misinformation over social media platforms. The assumption in research regarding Fake News is that the creators are intentionally misleading people to believe that the fake news is in fact credible. However, we posit that distrust of the scientific community has become so pervasive that it is instead the association with a peer reviewed scientific journal that makes new findings less credible to the general public
  
  Contrary to our hypothesis, we discovered that the perception of peer review increased the trustworthiness of claims. After running our experiment, we found that those who received treatment were around 10% more likely to trust the claim. This result was statistically significant at a 95% confidence level.

  <summary><b> Are National Parks Becoming More Attractive To Locals Post-Pandemic? </b></summary>
    
  ### Description
  
  With travel restrictions, border closures and shutdown of businesses across the globe throughout the pandemic, the
tourism industry has taken a significant financial hit and its outlook is still uncertain. According to the United Nations
World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), international tourist arrivals have fallen 72% between January 2020 and July
2021 for the Americas. For the world, the overall decline in the same period was reported to be 85%.
  
  This report seeks to answer the following research question. With statewide travel guidelines to avoid non-essential out-of-state and out-of-country travel in effect throughout the pandemic, our hypothesis is that this would heighten residentsâ€™ interest in taking local trips and exploring nature in sites near them during and shortly post-reopening. The purpose of this research is to examine the effect of the pandemic on visitation to national parks. Our goal is to determine the relationship between the number of visitations to parks in the United States and variables including the number of COVID-19 cases and vaccination rate. We will use a causal model to address this research question and determine if higher vaccination rates and lower COVID cases cause more national park visits.

  Interestingly, we determined that monthly park visits have increased with increased COVID cases, COVID deaths, and vaccination numbers. We believe this is due to reduced out-of-state travel and forcing people to find alternative activities during the pandemic like visit parks. More details can be found in the final report below.

  <summary><b> Understanding User Behavior Through Event Tracking </b></summary>
  
  ### Description
  
  The data engineering court at Renaissance Games is pleased to present our lords and ladies with an analytics pipeline to keep a watchful eye on the activities of the merchants within the market and also to note the comings of knights and ladies in the guilds.
  
  Our sorcery (stack) of choice is as follows:
  
  - Apache Bench - "game client" sending player events into data pipeline
  - Flask - app that runs the game Application Programming Interface
  - Kafka - platform for ingesting streaming data and passing to downstream applications
  - Spark - tool to filter and transform data and push to or pull from HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)
  - Hadoop - distributed file system for managing parquet files
  - Hive - intermediary to track and agree upon schema and create tables
  - Presto - query tool for summarizing and reporting analytics on purchases and guild activity
  
  For a detailed breakdown of randomly and manually generated events, prithee see the project report linked below.

  <summary><b> UFO Sightings And Proximity To Military Bases Exploratory Data Analysis</b></summary>
  
  ### Description
  This research examines various relationships between UFO sightings, military bases, and population in the United States. The data suggests that UFO sightings have increased rapidly in the early 2010s and less so in recent years. States with higher populations tend to have more sightings. After we normalize the data against population, Vermont, Montana, and Alaska appear to have the highest per capita sightings. Interestingly, Vermont and Alaska are among the states with the most military bases per capita as well. Our data demonstrates a positive relationship between the number of UFO sightings and the number of military bases. 
  
  Given the limitation of the data and the approach this research relies upon, the findings are for exploratory purposes and are not intended to draw any conclusions. The report and exploratory notebook are linked below.

  <summary><b>Are Democratic Voters Older Or Younger Than Republican Voters In 2020?</b></summary>
  
  ### Description
  In American politics, understanding voter demographics is very important. A good understanding of voter
demographics allows political parties and individual candidates to portray a message that can better connect
with its intended audience.
  
  Our research question scratches the surface of achieving this goal. By understanding basic demographics like
age, we can then conduct follow up research on what messages are more effective on certain age groups.
Research like this can lead to more informed decisions for campaigns and individual candidates.
  
  In this research we have determined that democratic voters mean age is not the same as republican voters
mean age at a 95% confidence level. However, the true difference is not very large which means a low
practical significance and results that do not help us too much. If anything, we did learn that to understand
political party demographics in America, we must look beyond age.

  <summary><b>Bay Area Bikeshare Analytics</b></summary>
  
  ### Description
  I analyze data from [Lyft Bay Wheels](https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels) to provide insight that will increase ridership. After analysis and queries, I recommend creating a slightly cheaper commuter plan that allows users to ride bikes only during commuter hours. My second recommendation is to offer 3 months of free membership to new customers that subscribe to a yearly plan in the cities of San Jose, Palo Alto, Redwood City and Mountain View. 
  
  The analysis process and the reasoning behind these recommendations can be found in the report outlined below.
